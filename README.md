# SQL-Challenge
## Challenge Instructions
This project included Data Engineering and Data Analysis creating SQL database of employees at Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. Using the six CSV files that held the information of each employee, SQL tables were designed and data was imported into the SQL database.

## Data Modeling and Engineering
Using QuickDBD, a ERD was sketched out and used to create table schema for the SQL Database. Specific data types, primary keys, and foreign keys were defined. Tables were created in the correct order to handle the foreign keys. The data from each CSV file was then imported into the corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
Once the database was created with tables of the imported data these steps were performed:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency count of employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name) in descending order.

The ERD image, table schemata(.sql), and queries(.sql) are saved to the repository.
